## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-xfs-support`
- `fix/config-validation-bug`
- `docs/improve-readme`
- `refactor/simplify-mapping-logic`

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```
feat(builder): add btrfs filesystem support

Implement btrfs filesystem creation for OCI rootfs builds.
Includes mkfs.btrfs invocation and type-specific flags.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(config): validate agent checksum format

Add validation to ensure checksums are in the format "sha256:...".
Previously accepted invalid formats that would fail at runtime.
```

### Code Style

- Run `make fmt` before committing
- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small

### Adding Features

1. **Discuss first**: Open an issue to discuss your proposed feature
2. **Write tests**: Add tests for new functionality
3. **Update docs**: Update README and examples if needed
4. **Follow patterns**: Match existing code structure

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
make test

# Specific package
go test -v ./internal/config

# With coverage
go test -cover ./...

# With race detection
go test -race ./...
```

### Writing Tests

**Unit Tests** (for business logic):

```go
func TestYourFeature(t *testing.T) {
    // Arrange
    input := "test input"
    
    // Act
    result := YourFunction(input)
    
    // Assert
    if result != expected {
        t.Errorf("got %v, want %v", result, expected)
    }
}
```

**Table-Driven Tests** (for multiple cases):

```go
func TestValidation(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   string
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {"valid input", "valid", false},
        {"invalid input", "invalid", true},
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            err := Validate(tt.input)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("got error %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### Test Coverage

- Target: 80%+ for business logic (config, mapping)
- Builders require manual/integration testing
- See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for our testing philosophy
